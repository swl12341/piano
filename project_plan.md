Project Overview: The "Theremin Hand" Web Application
The goal is to create a web-based musical instrument that uses a webcam to track the user's hand. The vertical position of the index finger will control the pitch of a synthesized sound, effectively turning the user's hand into a controller for a virtual theremin. The interface will display the video feed with hand landmarks overlaid, along with a visual musical scale to guide the user.

Core Functionality:
Webcam Access: Capture a live video stream from the user's camera.
Hand Detection: Use a real-time hand-tracking model to identify the position of the hand and its finger landmarks in the video feed.
Pointer Tracking: Isolate the landmark for the tip of the index finger and track its vertical (Y-axis) position.
Audio Synthesis: Generate a musical tone that can be turned on and off, with its pitch controlled dynamically.
Pitch Mapping: Map the finger's vertical position on the screen to a specific musical note from a predefined scale.
Visual Feedback: Display the webcam feed, the detected hand landmarks, and a visual representation of the musical scale (e.g., C, D, E, F, G, A, B). The currently playing note should be highlighted.
Recommended Technology Stack
This project can be built entirely with front-end web technologies, requiring no backend server.

Core Language: JavaScript (ES6+) for all application logic.
Markup & Styling: HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and presentation of the webpage.
Hand Tracking: Google's MediaPipe Hands. It's a high-fidelity, pre-trained machine learning model that runs efficiently in the browser via TensorFlow.js. It provides detailed 21-point landmarks for each hand, which is perfect for identifying fingertips.
Audio Synthesis: Tone.js. This is a powerful JavaScript library built on the Web Audio API. It simplifies the process of creating synthesizers and playing musical notes, making the code much cleaner than using the native Web Audio API directly.
Drawing & Visualization: HTML5 Canvas API. We will use a <canvas> element to draw the video frames, overlay the hand landmarks provided by MediaPipe, and display the musical scale UI.
Modular Breakdown
The application can be broken down into five key modules (which will be implemented within a single script.js file for simplicity, but organized logically).

UI_Module (HTML/CSS): The basic page layout. This includes the canvas, a hidden video element, and a "Start" button.
Camera_Module: Responsible for requesting access to the user's webcam and streaming the video feed.
HandTracking_Module (MediaPipe): Initializes the MediaPipe Hands model, processes video frames, and provides the landmark data.
Audio_Module (Tone.js): Initializes the synthesizer, and contains functions to start, stop, and change the pitch of the sound.
MainController_Module: The core logic that orchestrates everything. It takes landmark data from the HandTracking_Module, maps it to a note, and sends commands to the Audio_Module. It also controls the drawing on the canvas.
Step-by-Step Implementation Plan (Priority Order)
This plan is structured to build the application incrementally, ensuring each part works before moving to the next.

Priority 1: Basic HTML/CSS Structure and Project Setup
Goal: Create the basic webpage and include the necessary libraries.

Create index.html:
Set up a basic HTML5 document.
Include a <title>: "Theremin Hand".
In the <body>:
A <h1> title.
A <button id="startButton">Start</button> to initialize the application (crucial for browser audio policies).
A <div> to act as a container.
A <video id="webcam" style="display: none;"></video> element. It will be hidden but is required to stream video to MediaPipe.
A <canvas id="outputCanvas" width="640" height="480"></canvas> element. This is where everything will be displayed.
Include the required libraries via CDN at the end of the <body>:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/hands/hands.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/camera_utils/camera_utils.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/drawing_utils/drawing_utils.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tone/14.7.77/Tone.min.js"></script>
<script src="script.js"></script>
Create style.css:
Add basic centering for the content.
Style the canvas with a border (border: 2px solid black;).
Create script.js:
Leave it empty for now.
Priority 2: Webcam and Canvas Integration
Goal: Get the user's webcam feed and display it on the canvas.

In script.js, get references to the DOM elements:
const videoElement = document.getElementById('webcam');
const canvasElement = document.getElementById('outputCanvas');
const canvasCtx = canvasElement.getContext('2d');
const startButton = document.getElementById('startButton');
Initialize the webcam: Use the Camera utility from MediaPipe, which simplifies the process. This will be wrapped in the "Start" button's event listener.
// This will be called later when we integrate hand tracking.
// For now, it just draws the video frame.
function onFrame() {
    canvasCtx.clearRect(0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);
    canvasCtx.drawImage(videoElement, 0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);
    requestAnimationFrame(onFrame);
}

startButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    const camera = new Camera(videoElement, {
        onFrame: async () => {
            // We'll add MediaPipe processing here in the next step.
            // For now, we'll just draw the frame manually to test.
        },
        width: 640,
        height: 480
    });
    camera.start();
    
    // Start the manual drawing loop for testing.
    // This will be replaced by the MediaPipe onResults callback.
    onFrame();
});
Self-Correction: A manual requestAnimationFrame loop is good for testing, but MediaPipe's Camera utility provides its own onFrame callback. We should structure the code to use that. The next step will refine this.
Priority 3: Hand Tracking Integration
Goal: Detect the hand and draw the landmarks on the canvas over the video feed.

In script.js, initialize MediaPipe Hands:
const hands = new Hands({
    locateFile: (file) => `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/hands/${file}`
});

hands.setOptions({
    maxNumHands: 1,
    modelComplexity: 1,
    minDetectionConfidence: 0.5,
    minTrackingConfidence: 0.5
});
Define the onResults callback function: This function is triggered every time MediaPipe processes a frame and has results.
function onResults(results) {
    canvasCtx.save();
    canvasCtx.clearRect(0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);
    // Flip the canvas horizontally for a "mirror" view.
    canvasCtx.scale(-1, 1);
    canvasCtx.translate(-canvasElement.width, 0);

    // Draw the video frame.
    canvasCtx.drawImage(results.image, 0, 0, canvasElement.width, canvasElement.height);

    // If hand landmarks are detected, draw them.
    if (results.multiHandLandmarks) {
        for (const landmarks of results.multiHandLandmarks) {
            drawConnectors(canvasCtx, landmarks, HAND_CONNECTIONS, {color: '#00FF00', lineWidth: 5});
            drawLandmarks(canvasCtx, landmarks, {color: '#FF0000', lineWidth: 2});
        }
    }
    // We will add audio logic here later.
    canvasCtx.restore();
}

hands.onResults(onResults);
Connect MediaPipe to the camera inside the startButton listener:
startButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
    // Hide the button after starting
    startButton.style.display = 'none';

    const camera = new Camera(videoElement, {
        onFrame: async () => {
            await hands.send({image: videoElement});
        },
        width: 640,
        height: 480
    });
    camera.start();
});
At this point, running the application should show a mirrored webcam feed with green lines and red dots tracking your hand.

Priority 4: Audio Synthesis Setup
Goal: Create a synthesizer and make it play a test note.

In script.js, create a synthesizer and state variables:
// At the top of the file
let synth;
let soundEnabled = false;
let lastPlayedNote = null;
Initialize Tone.js and the synthesizer inside the startButton listener: This is critical because audio cannot start without user interaction.
startButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
    // ... (camera setup code from previous step) ...
    
    // Initialize Audio
    await Tone.start();
    synth = new Tone.Synth({
        oscillator: { type: 'sine' },
        envelope: { attack: 0.1, decay: 0.2, sustain: 0.5, release: 0.5 }
    }).toDestination();
    soundEnabled = true;
    console.log('Audio context started and synth created.');
});
Priority 5: Connecting Hand Position to Pitch (The Core Logic)
Goal: Use the index finger's Y-position to control the pitch of the synthesizer.

Define the musical scale: Add this to the top of script.js. We reverse it because Y=0 is the top of the screen (highest pitch).
const noteScale = ['C5', 'B4', 'A4', 'G4', 'F4', 'E4', 'D4', 'C4'];
Update the onResults function: This is where we will add the main logic.
function onResults(results) {
    // ... (drawing code from Priority 3) ...

    if (soundEnabled) {
        if (results.multiHandLandmarks && results.multiHandLandmarks.length > 0) {
            // Landmark 8 is the tip of the index finger.
            const indexFingerTip = results.multiHandLandmarks[0][8];
            const yPos = indexFingerTip.y; // This is a normalized value from 0.0 (top) to 1.0 (bottom)
            
            // Map the Y-position to a note in our scale.
            const noteIndex = Math.min(Math.floor(yPos * noteScale.length), noteScale.length - 1);
            const currentNote = noteScale[noteIndex];

            // Play the note, but only if it's different from the last one.
            if (currentNote && currentNote !== lastPlayedNote) {
                synth.triggerAttack(currentNote);
                lastPlayedNote = currentNote;
            }
        } else {
            // If no hand is detected, release the note.
            if (lastPlayedNote !== null) {
                synth.triggerRelease();
                lastPlayedNote = null;
            }
        }
    }

    // ... (canvasCtx.restore()) ...
}
Priority 6: Adding the Visual Scale UI
Goal: Draw the musical scale on the canvas and highlight the currently playing note.

Modify the onResults function again: Add drawing logic for the scale after drawing the hand.
function onResults(results) {
    // ... (drawing code for video and hand) ...
    
    // ... (audio logic code) ...

    // Draw the musical scale UI
    canvasCtx.restore(); // Restore before drawing UI so it's not mirrored.

    noteScale.forEach((note, index) => {
        const y = (index + 0.5) * (canvasElement.height / noteScale.length);
        canvasCtx.font = "24px Arial";
        
        // Highlight the currently playing note
        if (note === lastPlayedNote) {
            canvasCtx.fillStyle = 'green';
            canvasCtx.font = "bold 28px Arial";
        } else {
            canvasCtx.fillStyle = 'white';
        }
        canvasCtx.fillText(note, 20, y);
    });

    // The original canvasCtx.restore() is now here, but we should call it
    // before drawing UI, so we remove the duplicate.
}
Self-Correction: The canvas state needs careful management. The drawing order should be: 1. Flip canvas. 2. Draw mirrored video/hand. 3. Restore canvas to normal. 4. Draw UI elements. The code above has been corrected to reflect this.
